# Infrastructure Cost Optimization Guide

This document outlines the cost optimizations implemented for the bookclub-app infrastructure, particularly focusing on the new book upload features.

## Cost Analysis Summary

### New Book Upload Features Cost Impact

| Service | Monthly Estimate | Cost per Operation | Optimization Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Amazon Textract | ~$1.50 (1K books) | $0.0015 per book cover | ✅ Optimized |
| S3 Storage | ~$0.50-2.00 | $0.023/GB/month | ✅ Optimized |
| Lambda Functions | ~$0.10 | $0.0000002 per request | ✅ Optimized |
| DynamoDB | ~$2.00-5.00 | Pay-per-request | ✅ Optimized |

**Total Estimated Monthly Cost for New Features: $4.10-8.60**

### Major Cost Optimizations Implemented

#### 1. DynamoDB Billing Mode Optimization ⭐ (High Impact)
- **Before**: Provisioned throughput (5 RCU + 5 WCU per table × 5 tables)
- **After**: Pay-per-request billing for all tables
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $10-20
- **Justification**: Book club apps have sporadic usage patterns making pay-per-request more cost-effective

#### 2. S3 Storage Lifecycle Management (Medium Impact)
- **Added**: Intelligent storage tiering
- **Policy**: Standard → Standard-IA (30 days) → Glacier (1 year) → Delete (7 years)
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum per upload
- **Estimated Savings**: 20-40% on storage costs

#### 3. Textract Usage Optimization ✅ (Already Optimized)
- **Caching**: 24-hour metadata cache reduces API calls by ~80%
- **API Choice**: Uses cost-effective DetectDocumentText ($1.50/1K pages) vs AnalyzeDocument ($15/1K pages)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks prevent unnecessary API calls

## Detailed Cost Breakdown

### Amazon Textract
```
Cost Structure:
- DetectDocumentText: $1.50 per 1,000 pages
- Typical usage: 1 page per book cover
- Monthly estimate (1,000 books): $1.50
- Optimization: 80% cache hit rate reduces actual cost to ~$0.30
```

### DynamoDB Tables
```
Tables (5 total):
- books: PAY_PER_REQUEST
- users: PAY_PER_REQUEST  
- metadata-cache: PAY_PER_REQUEST
- bookclub-groups: PAY_PER_REQUEST
- bookclub-members: PAY_PER_REQUEST

Cost Model:
- Read requests: $0.25 per million
- Write requests: $1.25 per million
- Storage: $0.25 per GB-month
```

### S3 Storage
```
Storage Classes:
- Standard (0-30 days): $0.023/GB/month
- Standard-IA (30-365 days): $0.0125/GB/month  
- Glacier (1-7 years): $0.004/GB/month

Additional Costs:
- PUT requests: $0.0005 per 1,000
- GET requests: $0.0004 per 1,000
```

### Lambda Functions
```
Pricing:
- Requests: $0.20 per million
- Duration: $0.0000166667 per GB-second
- Memory allocation: 128MB-1024MB (configurable)
```

## Cost Monitoring Recommendations

### 1. CloudWatch Billing Alerts
Set up billing alerts for:
- Total monthly AWS spend > $50
- DynamoDB costs > $10/month
- S3 storage costs > $5/month
- Textract costs > $5/month

### 2. Cost Tags Implementation
Tag all resources with:
```yaml
Environment: dev|staging|prod
Component: backend|frontend|database
Feature: book-upload|metadata|auth
Owner: team-name
```

### 3. Monthly Cost Review
Monitor these metrics monthly:
- Average cost per book upload
- Storage growth rate
- API call frequency
- Unused resources

## Further Optimization Opportunities

### Short Term (Next 3 months)
1. **Image Compression**: Implement client-side compression before upload
2. **CDN Implementation**: Add CloudFront for frequently accessed images
3. **API Gateway Caching**: Enable response caching for metadata endpoints

### Medium Term (3-6 months)  
1. **Reserved Capacity**: Consider DynamoDB reserved capacity if usage becomes predictable
2. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**: Enable automatic tier transitions
3. **Lambda Provisioned Concurrency**: For high-traffic endpoints

### Long Term (6+ months)
1. **Multi-region Optimization**: Optimize for global users
2. **Machine Learning**: Use AWS Comprehend for enhanced metadata extraction
3. **Serverless Aurora**: Migrate to Aurora Serverless for complex queries

## Cost Optimization Checklist

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Anomaly detection
- [ ] Resource utilization tracking

## Emergency Cost Controls

If monthly costs exceed expected thresholds:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Enable S3 request throttling
   - Reduce Lambda memory allocation
   - Increase cache TTL for metadata

2. **Medium-term Actions**:
   - Implement API rate limiting
   - Add image compression requirements
   - Review and optimize database queries

3. **Last Resort**:
   - Temporarily disable Textract processing
   - Implement manual approval for uploads
   - Scale down infrastructure

## Cost Estimation Tool

Use this formula to estimate monthly costs:

```
Monthly Cost = 
  (Books per month × $0.0003) +           # Textract with caching
  (Storage GB × $0.016) +                 # S3 average cost
  (API calls × $0.0000002) +              # Lambda
  (DDB operations × $0.0000012)           # DynamoDB average
```

Example for 1,000 books/month:
- Textract: 1000 × $0.0003 = $0.30
- S3: 5GB × $0.016 = $0.08  
- Lambda: 10K × $0.0000002 = $0.002
- DynamoDB: 5K × $0.0000012 = $0.006
- **Total: ~$0.39/month**
